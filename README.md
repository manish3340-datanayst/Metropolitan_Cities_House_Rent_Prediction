# House Rent Prediction Web Application
This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** that predicts house rent prices across major Indian metropolitan cities. It demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a data science project â€” from data cleaning and model building to deployment using **Flask**.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to help users estimate monthly rent prices based on key features like **city**, **locality**, **BHK**, **size**, and **furnishing status**. Itâ€™s built with the intention of learning how to deploy a regression model in a real-world web application setting.

## Features
- Predicts house rent based on user input
- Trained using city-wise Indian rental data
- Fully integrated **web interface with dynamic dropdowns** (city â†’ locality)
- End-to-end data pipeline: cleaning, feature engineering, scaling, modeling
- **Flask-based deployment** of the trained model

---

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Web Framework:** Flask  
- **Frontend:** HTML (basic interface), Jinja2 templates  
- **Model Deployment:** Pickle serialization  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning:** Missing values, incorrect types, duplicates  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Categorical encoding, numerical scaling  
3. **Model:** Linear Regression  
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
5. **Deployment:** Serialized model using Pickle and served with Flask
